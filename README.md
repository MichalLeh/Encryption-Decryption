# Encryption-Decryption

Today, encryption and decryption algorithms are everywhere to protect our data. They are vital for sites that handle sensitive data, such as e-commerce sites that accept online card payments and login areas that require users to enter their credentials. Complex encryption algorithms are behind the scenes to ensure the security of data.
These simple algorithms only illustrate general ideas of encryption.
